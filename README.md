Applying Prandtlâ€™s 1-Equation for solving fully developed channel flow and comparing the data with DNS results from below research paper: 
R. D. Moser, J. Kim, and N. N. Mansour. Direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel  flow up to Re(frictional) =590. Physics of Fluids, 11(4):943{945, 1999.
Directly run the EVM.m file in mathlab such that the other matrix files can get loaded in the software.
